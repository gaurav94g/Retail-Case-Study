## RETAIL CASE STUDY

As the retail industry becomes more and more competitive on a daily basis, meeting customer expectations through process optimization in service company operations is more crucial than ever. For a business to survive, it is critical to channel and manage data in a way that benefits both customers and revenues.

A retailer's customer data should ideally show how well it has reached and retained its clientele. Retailers used variables like conversion rate, average order value, buy frequency, and total amount spent in recent transactions to create reports that summarized consumer behavior. These metrics offered a broad understanding of the behavioural patterns of the clients.

The process of identifying and providing data-driven insights into previous and anticipated future consumer behavior is known as customer intelligence. Customer intelligence needs to develop derived metrics by combining transactional and behavioral data in order to be effective.

## GOAL

The main aim is to apply data analytics throughout the retail process for big players globally. This involves tracking popular products, forecasting sales and future demand through predictive simulation, and optimizing product placements and offers. The overarching goal is to enhance decision-making and strategy implementation at various stages of the retail business to stay competitive and ensure survival.
